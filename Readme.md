# Machine Learning  

This repository contains various **Machine Learning models and experiments along with EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)** implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`). The goal is to understand, practice, and apply different ML algorithms to real-world datasets and recommend insights through EDA.
